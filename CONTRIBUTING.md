# Contributing

We are open to, and grateful for, any contributions made by the community. By contributing to Bosta Nodejs SDK, you agree to abide by the [code of conduct](https://github.com/bostaapp/bosta-nodejs/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Commit Messages

Commit messages should be verb based, using the following pattern:

- `Fixing ...`
- `Adding ...`
- `Updating ...`
- `Removing ...`

### Documentation

Please update the [docs](README.md) accordingly so that there are no discrepancies between the API and the documentation.

### Developing

- `npm run test` run the jasmine and mocha tests
- `npm run build` run webpack and bundle the source

### Releasing

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.
